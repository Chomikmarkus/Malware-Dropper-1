# Malware-Dropper
Demise Dropper
This File dropper is Currently undetected by virus total (scantime UD not runtime)
How it works: this file dropper will create a text file then write batch and powershell code into it to download your file link
and run it, then the txt file will be converted to a bat file and ran.
to use this go to the dropper stub sln and build it, then go to the outputted exe and get rid of the .exe extension and rename it to 
Stub. now go to Demise dropper sln and build it then go back to the Stub file and move it to the same folder as where the demise dropper has been built.
now run the demise Dropper and put in your payload link and whatever you want the exe to be named then press build and your file will be built :)


extra: Builder (this file dropper comes with a UI so you can put your payload link in and then press build to build the malware dropper)
extra: Dropper also copys your file to the victims startup
